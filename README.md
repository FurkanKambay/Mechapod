You are stranded on a dead planet that's been taken over by ancient artificial technology built by the planet's originally native inhabitants.

By reverse engineering their tech, you must use the scraps you find around the crash site to get a Golem started and build more Frames to ensure your survival.

Will you live to see the light of another day? <br>
Only your skills in the battlefield will tell!

<h2>How to play</h2>
<p>
    Use your <strong>mouse</strong> üñ±Ô∏è (or touchscreen üì±) to lead your
    <em>Frames</em> into battle! Collect scrap to buy upgrades, and beat the
    waves of enemies. There's a mini-boss too, and we're planning on adding a
    full-on Boss after the jam!

| <img width="400px" src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzIyMzM4MTk4LmpwZw==/original/kZATuh.jpg" alt="concept art: battle screen" />     | We were inspired by the "getting an engine started" suggestion in the theme announcement video, and thought about robots/golems. We decided on a two-phase gameplay, similar to games like *9 Kings* and *Dome Keeper*, but with a much simpler day phase, since we wanted to keep the scope very small for the jam. We also had plans for deck-building elements, we scrapped that idea! |
| <img width="400px" src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzIyMzM4MTk0LmpwZw==/original/%2FNJjxp.jpg" alt="concept art: 'garage' screen" /> | We debated between a medieval fantasy or a sci-fi setting, and ultimately decided on mixing elements of both. *Iron Giant* and *Pacific Rim* were some of the mood directions we went for.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| <img width="400px" src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzIyMzM4MjA2LmpwZw==/original/%2FCe7oj.jpg" alt="concept art: a robot crab" />    | For the enemies, we thought that the concept of "artificial life taking over" was better represented by "nature" itself, so we went with animal-like robots, which ended up being crabs. We had plans to add more creature types and a unique boss, but we scrapped those due to the small scope.                                                                                         |
