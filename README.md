You are stranded on a dead planet that's been taken over by ancient artificial technology
built by the planet's long-extinct native inhabitants.

Gather **scraps** around the crash site, reverse engineer the fauna's tech to **build** more Frames,
and **upgrade** your Golem for new abilities to ensure your survival.

Will you live to see the light of another day? <br>
Only your skills in the battlefield will tell!

| <img width="400px" src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzIyMzM4MTk4LmpwZw==/original/kZATuh.jpg" alt="concept art: battle screen" />     | We were inspired by the "getting an engine started" suggestion in the theme announcement video, and thought about robots/golems. We decided on a two-phase gameplay, similar to games like *9 Kings* and *Dome Keeper*, but with a much simpler day phase, since we wanted to keep the scope very small for the jam. We also had plans for deck-building elements, we scrapped that idea! |
| <img width="400px" src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzIyMzM4MTk0LmpwZw==/original/%2FNJjxp.jpg" alt="concept art: 'garage' screen" /> | We debated between a medieval fantasy or a sci-fi setting, and ultimately decided on mixing elements of both. *Iron Giant* and *Pacific Rim* were some of the mood directions we went for.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| <img width="400px" src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzIyMzM4MjA2LmpwZw==/original/%2FCe7oj.jpg" alt="concept art: a robot crab" />    | For the enemies, we thought that the concept of "artificial life taking over" was better represented by "nature" itself, so we went with animal-like robots, which ended up being crabs. We had plans to add more creature types and a unique boss, but we scrapped those due to the small scope.                                                                                         |
