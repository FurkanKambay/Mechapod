<h2>How to play</h2>
<p>
    Use your <strong>mouse</strong> 🖱️ (or touchscreen 📱) to lead your
    <em>Frames</em> into battle! Collect scrap to buy upgrades, and beat the
    waves of enemies. There's a mini-boss too, and we're planning on adding a
    full-on Boss after the jam!

<h2>Concept & Inspirations</h2>
<p>
    We were inspired by the "getting an engine started" suggestion in the theme announcement video, and thought about robots/golems.
    We decided on a two-phase gameplay, similar to games like <i>9 Kings</i> and <i>Dome Keeper</i>, but with a much simpler day phase,
    since we wanted to keep the scope very small for the jam. We also had plans for deck-building elements, we scrapped that idea!

</p>

<p>
    We debated between a medieval fantasy or a sci-fi setting, and ultimately decided on mixing elements of both.
    <i>Iron Giant</i> and <i>Pacific Rim</i> were some of the mood directions we went for.

</p>

<p>
    For the enemies, we thought that the concept of "artificial life taking over" was better represented by "nature" itself,
    so we went with animal-like robots, which ended up being crabs.
    We had plans to add more creature types and a unique boss, but we scrapped those due to the small scope.
