    You are stranded on a dead planet that's been taken over by ancient artificial technology
    built by the planet's long-extinct native inhabitants.
</p>
<p>
    Gather <strong>scraps</strong> around the crash site, reverse engineer the fauna's tech to <strong>build</strong> more Frames,
    and <strong>upgrade</strong> your Golem for new abilities to ensure your survival.
</p>
<em>
    Will you live to see the light of another day? <br />
    Only your skills in the battlefield will tell!

<h2>Concept & Inspirations</h2>
<p>

    We were inspired by the "getting an engine started" suggestion in the theme announcement video, and thought about robots/golems.
    We decided on a two-phase gameplay, similar to games like <cite>9 Kings</cite> and <cite>Dome Keeper</cite>, but with a much simpler day phase,
    since we wanted to keep the scope very small for the jam. We also had plans for deck-building elements, we scrapped that idea!
</p>

    We debated between a medieval fantasy or a sci-fi setting, and ultimately decided on mixing elements of both.
    <cite>Iron Giant</cite> and <cite>Pacific Rim</cite> were some of the mood directions we went for.
</p>

    For the enemies, we thought that the concept of "artificial life taking over" was better represented by "nature" itself,
    so we went with animal-like robots, which ended up being crabs.
    We had plans to add more creature types and a unique boss, but we scrapped those due to the small scope.
