<h2>Mechapod</h2>
<p>You are stranded on a dead planet that's been taken over by ancient technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By reverse engineering their craft, you must use your time and the scraps you find around to get a Golem started and
    hack more Frames, that will ensure your survival.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will you live to see the light of another day?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only your skills in the battlefield will tell!<br></p>
<h2>Controls</h2>
<p><strong>Mouse</strong>: Move your <em>Frames</em>, and aim your ability<br><strong>LMB</strong>: Activate ability</p>
<h2>How to play</h2>
<p>Use your <strong>mouse </strong>(or touchscreen) to lead your <em>Frames </em>into battle! Collect scrap to buy
    upgrades, and beat the waves of enemies. There's a mini-boss too, and we're planning on adding a full-on Boss after
    the jam!</p>
